## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- The `<img>` element is an inline element, so placing another HTML element on a new line directly below it can introduce unwanted gaps. This happens because whitespace (such as line breaks) in the HTML is rendered as space in the browser, resulting in a visible gap between the image and the following element.

### Useful resources
- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox) - This helped me with flexbox and gave clear instructions on how to use it.
